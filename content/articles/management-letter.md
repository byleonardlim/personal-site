## Overview
Audit workflows are historically broken—manual, tedious, and prone to error. We didn't just want to patch the process; we wanted to revolutionize it.

This case study isn't just about an AI tool; it's about how we used **Vibe Coding** to bypass traditional, sluggish design cycles and deliver a high-impact solution in record time. We took Allison, our lead persona, from juggling scattered notes and manual tracing to a seamless, AI-powered workflow that writes itself.

The results speak for themselves: an 80% reduction in prep time and a complete transformation of how auditors work. We proved that with the right approach, you can solve complex professional challenges without the wait.

## Impact
- **80%**  
faster draft prep time
- **70%**  
fewer citation errors
- **2×**  
issue-identification speed

The tool is slated to be released firmwide by Q2 2026, benefiting both internal and external auditors. The rollout will require domain-specific audit data and collaboration with subject matter experts to fine-tune issue identification and citation generation.

## Discovery

### Meet Allison
Allison is drowning. She’s staring at an empty Word document, the cursor blinking like a taunting metronome eating into her billable hours. "Where do I even begin?"

She isn't a hypothetical user. She represents every auditor who finishes the fieldwork only to face the real nightmare: the Management Letter. It’s the moment where scattered notes, buried evidence, and fragmented comments need to coalesce into a pristine, client-ready document.

### The Challenge
“Just trace the finding back to the source.” It sounds simple. It’s not.

For Allison, this request demands she become a human search engine. She has to hunt through thousands of files, pages, and paragraphs to validate a single claim. It’s not just boring—it’s dangerous. Every manual search is a potential error, and every lost hour is a blow to efficiency. The process wasn't just slow; it was broken.

## Solution

### Vibe Coding: A New Design Paradigm
Traditional design failed us. Our initial workshops yielded weak insights, and the innovation partner handed us an impossible timeline. We couldn't afford the luxury of weeks spent on static wireframes. We needed to move.

We pivoted to **Vibe Coding**. We bypassed the pixel-pushing and went straight to code. Leveraging AI-assisted development, we translated abstract concepts into a working, breathing interface in days.

This changed everything. We didn't ask Allison, "What do you need?" We showed her. We put a living product in her hands and said, "Try this." The prototype was so effective it didn't just validate our hypothesis—it became the foundation of our MVP. We went from "idea" to "ready for engineering" at a velocity traditional methods can't touch.

### The Engine
We didn't just build a search tool; we built a contextual intelligence engine.

Using advanced NLP, the tool scans the chaos of audit evidence, extracts the signal from the noise, and hard-links every finding to its source.

For Allison, the workflow transformed:
-  **Input** She feeds in the fieldwork.
-  **Synthesis** The AI drafts well-structured, grouped findings.
-  **Verification** Every suggestion comes with deep-linked context.
-  **Execution** One click inserts the finding, formatted and compliant.

No hunting. No formatting nightmares. Just work, done.
